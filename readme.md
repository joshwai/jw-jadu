# Josh Wainwright code test

## Instructions

Simply place the entire testing folder into any local server environment, XAMPP, MAMP etc.

## Time

### isPalindrome

3-5 minutes

This was super simply, all I needed to do was reverse the input string and see if they matched.

I realised early on that these checks were case sensitive so made sure to account for this going forward.

### isAnagram

10-15 minutes

This was slightly more tricky and almost had me iterating through each character but I managed to stop myself.

I found a very useful count_chars() function that returns an array of all the characters in a string. By comparing the two arrays you can quickly find whether 2 string are an anagram or not.

### isPangram

20-25 minutes

Being completely honest I got really stuck on this one. I ended up running to google for help. Without restricting myself to avoid using google where possible I would've been able to complete this much quicker.

Looking back through the code I realised I would've been able to get to the correct answer but it wouldn't have been as elegant. To make it clear I fully understand what the program is doing I just over complicated the problem when trying to tackle it myself.
